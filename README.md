Cribbage Game
-------------

I wrote this cribbage game while attending RIT in Rochester, NY in 2008. It was
for a school project and represented my JavaScript abilities at the time. For
the most part nothing has changed, but there have been minor adjustments made from
the original submitted work.

I had dedicated this project to my late grandfather who taught me how to play
Cribbage well. While a majority of the game is luck, he was skillful at
cutthroat and stole several points from me over the years that we played.

Instead of letting the dedication linger, I'm going to be giving it a facelift.

Follow along as I incrementally improve the codebase with everything I've
learned since then.
